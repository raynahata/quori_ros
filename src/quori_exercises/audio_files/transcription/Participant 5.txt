As a recap, you will be completing a series of exercises,
and I will be evaluating you on your performance.
I will be recording your video and audio during the session.
I will also be asking you questions about your experience.
I will be using this information to improve my coaching skills.
If you have any questions, my assistant can answer them for you.
I have no questions.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
How old are you?
21.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Yes.
Why do you exercise?
Mental health.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
7.
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises, in between each set.
There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen next to you to see how to perform the exercises.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
My assistant can help you with any questions you have.
I have no questions.
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like, amazing
effort.
Let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like, focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
The first way?
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session.
