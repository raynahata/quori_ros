Monday, separately.
Oh, wait. I can give you the...
I have a heart rate monitor for you.
Okay, where do you want it?
So, just, like, on your skin, but, like, on your arm. Either arm. I'll let your upper arm.
Oh, okay.
Only I have more in short sleeves.
Yeah, maybe I can, like, tell people.
Yeah, yeah. Like, am I wearing a gigantic sportswear anyway? Yes.
It doesn't really matter, but...
Yeah.
It should roll up under your shirt too, I think.
Yeah, it's just like the sleeves on this are not forgiving.
Yeah, if you just make sure it's not sliding around, then.
I like the chair setup.
Right?
You don't see anything.
Do you want me to fill out the...
Hold on, hold on.
Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study.
My name is Cori. How are you today?
Fine.
Great, thanks for sharing. I am glad to hear that.
Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form in front of you.
Please take a minute to read through the form. Please write your name when you are done.
Do you have paper forms for old people?
No, but we can get those.
Big font size.
Yeah.
I was just thinking, or like, maybe a regular mouse or something?
Oh yeah.
Just...
She was gonna bring her iPod.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
Please read the block below your signature and choose one of the three options.
Okay, done.
Thank you for signing the consent form.
Some sweet videos here.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises in between each set.
There will be a rest period.
Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.
We have some dumbbells here for you to use if you choose to.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
No.
My assistant can help you with any questions you have.
No, thanks.
Okay.
I clearly made a mistake, however.
Yeah.
And they don't go along.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
How old are you?
42.
42.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Yes.
Why do you exercise?
to be fit enough to do the things I want to do.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
Seven.
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
We're just going to have to go through the exercises again.
Okay.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises, in between each set.
There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.
We have some dumbbells here for you to use if you choose to.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant
can help you with any questions you have. Nope.
Why is part of Cory's projector face cut off? I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you'd like to be coached. For example, when you make a
a mistake. I could give you feedback that sounds like, amazing effort. Let's aim for
full range next time. Or I could say something like, focus on improving your range. Keep
pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way? The second way. Thank you
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session.
Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells if you want to use them.
I think the thing it tells me not to do.
Yeah, yeah.
The thing that it tells you not to do.
Yep.
That's not good.
Okay.
I think the robot understood me well, Raina.
What?
So, what's the first?
Yeah.
Okay, so you're going to go ahead and do your
first one.
Okay, so you're going to go ahead and do your
first one.

How many children do I have?
Is this just because of the AI caring form?
Yes.
It's going to ask your grandchildren too.
Yeah.
Oh, I need to.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.
We can just write that one.
Yeah.
I just don't want to overwrite it.
This one's just too long.
Yeah, that's because I updated it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We can just read it.
Or I can bring in my file.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alright, do not go to the next page.
Okay.
Do not go to the next page.
That's totally telling the credit.
Okay, so yeah, you can just pick up the dumbbells and just stand within the box for the robot.
Get ready to start set one of four.
You will be doing bicep curls.
Start bicep curls now.
Great work, you're showing impressive progress.
Fantastic job on that last rep.
Keep up the good work.
You're one of those girls trying to break it.
Okay, fine.
You know, I'll take you personally or in advance.
The first law that I went to was for children with autism.
You're doing great. Just a few more to go.
I'm just a client this morning.
Almost done. Rest.
I test everything.
That's why I went first.
I know. I was like, I could sign up for Thursday, but no.
Yeah, no, I was like, I was like, Liz would break it.
I was surprised you didn't do the first slot on Monday.
Yeah, I know. I was like...
What's it doing?
Rest for 20 more seconds.
Oh.
Or he's like, it told you.
Yeah.
It's my own fault for not listening.
At least you know the timing is correct.
Mm-hmm.
Or he can't be as beautiful, okay?
It better be. There's a paper about it.
Get ready to start set two of four. You will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.
You're doing great. Keep up the strong work.
I'm not doing great.
Well maybe it thinks you just can't move one of your arms so it's not going to know where you put them.
I switched arms.
Fantastic job. Nice control with good speed.
You're doing great. Keep pushing through. Almost done.
Come on, tracker.
Rest.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
Get ready to start set 3 of 4.
You will be doing lateral raises.
lateral raises now.
Is it freeze? It's because you're not doing what it expects you to do?
It can't track that there's reps happening sometimes?
So is it supposed to be...
Almost done.
Is it counting?
Yes.
That's how it decides how long it is, or is it an interval?
It's a time... I don't know.
It did catch that.
There was a... yeah.
Sometimes it catches when it's wrong, but it won't tell you.
Yeah. Like, it did catch.
Yeah.
It just depends on the conditions.
Do you support him?
Yeah.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
You have to make the same mistake multiple times on the roll sometimes for it to...
I'm giving you too much credit.
Why are you saying her?
Not that she knows what she's talking about herself.
obviously. It hasn't seen the surveys already or anything. No. Get ready to start set four of four.
You will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises now.
You're doing great. Keep it up.
Fantastic work on those lateral raises.
You're almost there.
Almost done.
Rest.
Round complete.
Please fill out a survey about this realm.
Get ready to start set one of four.
You will be doing bicep curls.
Start bicep curls now.
Focus on maintaining proper form despite feeling fatigue.
Focus on maintaining good form despite feeling fatigued.
Almost done.
Rest.
Rest.
Lateral raise doesn't really add up after a while.
Yeah.
Everyone comes in here and gets a workout.
That was my odd.
Maybe not a bicep workout, but at least a little bit of lateral raise.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
We had bigger weights before.
Oh yeah.
Like I think we've gone up to like eight or ten maybe?
And then like for bicep curls we could still get them together.
Yeah.
Did you sign Pat up?
We tried.
We tried.
Get ready to start set two of four.
You will be doing bicep curls.
I need to bring a bone weight.

So it can't be specific?
It can.

Erin seems slightly concerned about this thing going into color.
Yeah. Yeah.
I am concerned about this color.
Clearly it's really stable.
I thought it would be pretty different.
Oh yeah.
I think Greg said he's going to give her the proper color.
Get ready to start set 3 of 4.
You will be doing lateral raises.
Start lateral raises now.
Thank you.
Almost done.
That's not a bug.
Rest.
It just won't...it's the future.
So you don't accidentally shame old people?
The thing is if you keep...if they're going really slow, you don't want to keep yelling at them.
Yeah.
For being too slow.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
Get ready to start set four of four.
You will be doing lateral raises.
Start lateral raises now.
Focus on keeping your shoulders level for better form.
Focus on maintaining proper form, even when fatigued.
Almost done.
Rest.
Round complete.
Please fill out a survey about this round.
All right.
I'm going to put a message.
I hope you're not going to.
Yeah.
I would click next once the next round.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll write that.
So you're learning things.
Uh-huh.
You can also just make it all in English, that survey,
the round survey and the final survey.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
Are we going to load once?
That's true.
Can you change the file name of that one too?
This one is one.
You're going to change one?
I will, yeah.
OK.
Before, because I don't want to.
I guess when we upload it, I just don't want it to.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll change it to .
Or I guess when we upload it.
I guess it'll be different types of stuff.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We can talk.
I need you to do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Are you done?
I'm done.
Okay.
Are you done?
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't know if people are going to notice.
Notice.
Like, rate differently for the awesome job stuff.
The part that's tricky, and that was tricky even when I ran the SAS like last year, where it was just like, did you pilot?
No.
Okay, so the study set up was basically, they did one round, so you did two rounds here, so they did three rounds in that one.
The first round was the robot didn't say anything.
That was like our neutral baseline.
And then they got a randomized order of firm or encouraging.
And the whole purpose of that was to basically be like, can people tell the difference?
Yeah.
And can, do people perform differently?
Mm-hmm.
And we did find that people could, like, tell.
Yeah.
And that people perform differently.
This one is, I think, because we have that validation of, like, these things are different.
Yeah, yeah.
We hopefully can see, like, okay, if we, like, ask people stuff in the beginning, how does
that kind of correlate with what they say?
Yeah.
Well, I wonder too, like, if you have very motivated people, then maybe they're more,
they're going to be like more circumspect about it as opposed to random undergrads hitting
fives all the way down.
Yeah.
Right.
And I think the other part that's tricky is like, it's also dependent, like what you hear
from the robot is dependent on how well you do.
Right.
Like if you do, this is something I struggled with last, last year too, but it's like, okay,
if you get the encouraging robot, but then you make a bunch of mistakes, then you're
going to view that robot as more critical than the firm one,
but that's not because of what the robot's doing.
It's based on what you do, actually.
And so each person isn't seeing the same,
isn't hearing the same things from the robot.
So that just makes it, we just kind of hope that there's
enough of a balance of differences
that it kind of all balance.
Did you think of a specific question
that I had in there?
The last three questions.
Oh, seems fine.
Seems OK, yeah.
I took the three-question one just because.
And then the questions that you heard from the robot
were basically me translating them to the question form.
Oh, OK.
Yeah.
The one after age is the one that I did.
Yeah.
I think if the screen wasn't frozen,
I could ask you, I could show you the questions.
