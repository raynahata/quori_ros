What? I'm gonna log into my computer.
Okay, ready.
Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study.
My name is Corey. How are you today?
I'm doing great. How are you?
I am good. Thank you for asking.
Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form in front of you.
Please take a minute to read through the form. Please write your name when you are done.
Please read the blog below your signature and choose one of the three options.
Thank you for signing the consent form.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Yeah, I do.
Why do you exercise?
Because it feels good.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
There are like a seven?
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be vice-up curls in the next two or lateral raises in between each set.
There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.
Okay, I see.
My computer just went...
Okay.
Okay, I see you vice-up.
Okay, I think I got it.
We have some dumbbells here for you to use if you choose to.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
My assistant can help you with any questions you have.
No, I think I'm good.
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coach.
For example, when you make a mistake, I can give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort.
Let's aim for full range next time, or I can say something like focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
I think I like the first way.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session.
Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells if you want to use them.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm going to add to the fourth thing.
Do you want me to...
Okay, we're just going to let this run.
Yeah.
Let's find.
Just before I forget.
So I'm going to hit next here.
I'm going to fill out the intake.
So what I need you... after you finish, you have to go in and look at resting heart rate.
And then we can add that in.
How do you look at some resting heart rate?
So go to your intake logs and it should be in your intake log.
Unlike the last one.
Oh, I know you put that in.
You also do low resting heart rate.
Thank you, by the way.
What is it?
62.
Okay.
So 62.
And then I am 28.
Yes.
It's very young Asian toast.
Huh?
Very young for an aging adult.
I got you now.
I don't know you see keep putting resting heart rate in the intake log.
We might...
I don't know if we want to ask how old are you?
Or like... because otherwise like...
You have to like look over the person's shoulder and see what number they're going to.
I can add it in here.
I can be like resting in one of the evaluation I can be like, how old are you?
Yeah, yeah.
It will like...
When you're asking all those questions.
Why is my computer...
I'm so annoyed at it.
Okay.
It's fine.
It's fine.
Yeah.
Does that realize the transition between asking the type and then just going straight to like go to them bells is bad?
So I'm going to be like after you ask them, I think it's ready to answer your question.
Now we can start this one.
Is there anything else you want me to ask them during the evaluation?
Age wise or Democrat?
I think that's it.
Because that's only thing we like actually need for...
Okay.
So participants do not go to the next stage.
So do we...
I don't have any notes here.
Okay.
So now we should be ready to go into round one.
Yeah.
If we run through this, we can't show.
We can just double check that.
So the audio is clearly recording because I can see it.
Yeah.
We can double check that the video works and then look at the data.
Yeah.
And then we start.
Did you pick the right thing for...
So you have to...
We have to look at this.
Where's my...
So the first round is encouraging.
So you have to go into...
I can also do this part of that.
Yeah.
So that's correct.
Yeah.
And then...
And then the next round would be...
Yes.
Okay.
I hope this works.
Get ready to start.
Set one of four.
You will have to do it by hand.
That's a good luck.
Start by set pearls now.
I'm going to do a little bit more.
Thanks for your work, man.
See what?
Look at what...
You see what it looks like?
It looks like the blocks.
Yeah.
You see like it's been waterlogged.
Almost done.
Yeah.
Maybe it also gets...
It's rest.
Don't we all...
I need to restart.
Yeah.
Why does...
I'm just up.
That was a read that you wanted like a...
Another signal of like...
Stop.
So it's like...
Stop.
Got it.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
People have that question a lot.
It's like a...
It's a question of mine.
Yeah.
When you're doing really encouraging...
Do you have the arms like party style?
No.
It does like move like more though.
It's like...
Wow.
Because the reason I can pick those is because like people saw that as happy.
Yeah.
Get ready to start set two and four.
You will be doing by set pearls.
Start by set pearls now.
So you see like if you scroll down a little bit on there,
No, on the...
In the code.
Yeah.
How there's like a cadence.
Yeah.
So that...
You're crushing those spice sets pearls.
You're crushing them.
Keep up the good work.
I'm like...
I don't know if I want to like...
So we did that full study that online study.
And like people were like...
I definitely don't want to...
Well done.
The form is looking really good today.
So...
Do I want to...
The people are like two or three for like basically all of...
So...
I guess we get like to see what people say like...
Almost done.
Yeah.
Rest.
Because like the first one I didn't say a lot.
But this second one is said like two or three things.
So...
Are people doing...
Are people doing two sets of this entire code?
Yes.
Okay.
So I have to run it again.
Yes.
Okay.
And you change the style.
Yeah.
Style.
Okay.
And it has the timestamp in there so...
Rest.
20 more seconds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the title or style.
You won't be doing the lateral raises now.
Yeah.
Start lateral raises now.
Because the ordering changes is literally just for like counterbalance.
Yeah.
So...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
Do we want to make people do one one and then one one?
Because it still has four total.
Um...
Because like they're doing two rounds.
two rounds of two right? Two rounds of four. Two rounds of weight. Yes.
By the cost of a lot of rings and then makes a total of eight to eight. Do we want to shrink
and just throw in focus? He got the good work.
I think it's not enough to almost done.
We'll see how long this time.
The first pilot says it's way too long and we should have been always.
I mean, I think it's going to take four years. Most of the time is literally sitting there.
Yeah. The other thing we can do is have a chair.
Have a chair.
Right.
This will be a little stress.
It will take 20 more seconds.
Yeah.
Put the laptop here, put the phone here for recording purposes.
And then you just have to make sure you're not going to like whack it.
I think you're not going to whack it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Then it'll all be like, oh, he's got the Michael be close to which will be next.
Yeah.
Get ready to start set four.
You will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises now.
Whisper AI does the whole transcribing and doing the person one person two.
But there are parts of the key.
So yeah, I don't.
Yeah.
I did have the whole close up and that's one to one.
Your horn is looking great on these raises.
Now, maybe you actually trade the thumb on my own data.
You're 100% mad.
Wow. How do I have that?
Okay, fantastic. Keep up the good work.
On the next round, I'll do some like bad ones.
I'm going to see for the like, give us something.
Strong.
Do less.
Almost done.
Yeah.
Rest.
Round complete.
Please fill out a survey about this round.
Okay, perfect.
Can you comment out the plot.show in this study session's file?
Because we don't need to see that every time.
Okay, so and then the next one is going to be firm.
Yeah.
Um.
I'm going to have one for show.
The last file is one.
Okay.
I don't want to put out of this.
Once you close all the plots that you quit by itself.
Yeah.
Any additional comments?
Okay, next.
Okay.
And then I am ready for.
For round two.
Right?
Just for reference, like this morning, the start says we're running for.
You will be doing bicep curls.
That bicep curls now.
Did you feel that we're on our space?
I think I've got backseptive dry.
Okay.
Yeah.
Like at the end of each day.
Yeah.
That's what we did before was like make just upload all the files to Google Drive.
Yeah.
Because especially the video file would quite large.
Yeah.
So I think like what we did was like that was the last thing we did in the day.
And it's like the light run over night.
Because it takes forever.
Yeah.
And then you can just free up stores.
Especially when we're running like one, two or three people a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's like we're not going to run out of stores.
No.
Almost done.
Most of the time you do.
You can also just bring like a local hard drive.
Yeah.
If you wanted to.
Yeah.
I mean, even like a terabyte one of the two people used to use this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I hope you have a CBC.
That recording.
I have to.
That's fine.
What is he going to say?
The transcripts are simply not one more seconds.
It's like, it's like it's said it hurt Aaron.
But it.
It said Aaron has a bunch.
Random crap lines.
Oh.
Good.
Good.
Good.
But it's better than like having nothing.
Yeah.
Get ready to start set to it for you will be doing bicep curls.
Start bicep curls now.
I think it's a good crazy.
Go crazy and go talk shaving off your entire head.
I was like.
Ruse like red.
I just said, yeah, you know, I just shaved it all back and died the rest of the green.
Nice.
I'm going to look this year.
Focus on maintaining proper elbow alignment throughout the exercise.
Come on.
I feel like I'm right now.
Almost done.
Wow, it's really like you said.
It's so much.
Sometimes I feel like the arm or the bench, it gets stuck.
Yeah.
So until like jiggle a little bit and then it'll.
One day, it's going to pop right off the song again.
It's one more set.
Well, yeah, I'm pleasantly surprised at how.
There's no shot your heart rate 64 while you're doing this.
Oh, yeah, probably.
Looks like five.
I stand up.
Get ready to start set three and four.
You will be doing lateral raises.
Now.
Oh, yeah.
So we have to make sure this one here is also for good.
All the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we can take them else with us.
Yeah.
We can bring up power strength.
We maintain proper form to prevent shoulder injury.
I'm trying to like that.
But it's fine.
It's not very encouraging the way that that feedback was.
I'm not trying to focus on maintaining power strength.
Yeah.
Okay, good.
I think you don't like firm feedback.
I guess I'll end up here.
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to spill it out of the survey.
I'll tell them.
Like, I that I like it.
Almost done.
Yeah.
Rest.
My motivation is lower.
Exactly.
Yeah, you don't.
You're like, I don't know on.
Do this.
Yeah.
I'm going to try.
What if I'm sitting down?
This chair is not ideal.
You can rest for 20 more seconds.
That's why I'll just sit up here.
I just want to as a test to see if it'll still work.
Because I'm thinking we can have a chair for people to sit in while they're filling out the surveys.
The importance of the survey.
You know where you're going to be in the lateral raises.
Start lateral raises.
I was doing you work with it for the first year.
I guess so.
What is it?
Gen Z. Are you Gen Z?
I'm 2000.
I don't know what I'm the one who holds up on the end of the level.
I'm 20.
I'm 20.
I have to do it.
Gen Z.
Yeah, I'm Gen Z.
Yeah, it's 20 more seconds.
Hey, go!
You can look at this chair works.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think the camera angle is not good.
It's almost done.
Rest.
Or if you lower the survey.
Please fill out a survey about this round.
It's just a round two.
It's fine.
Because it doesn't know what round it's doing right now.
Okay, so filling out round two.
The other thing that's interesting is that if you keep the mic here, people are going to
talk to themselves while they're filling this out and you might get something interesting.
True.
So they might be monitoring.
I might be like, oh yeah, this is bad.
I did feel to show a point that I was still showing.
Did you save it?
Yes.
I didn't save what it had.
Oh, wait, where did you comment it was in the study session?
Yes.
There was a controller dot plot angles too.
Got it.
Yeah.
Can I just punch that out?
Yeah.
Okay, and then we have a final survey.
Not final.
Just a robot final survey.
Yeah.
It's all the same, right?
Yeah, but there's one more survey.
I combined it though.
Oh, you did?
Yeah.
So it's all the one page.
So it's easier.
So I definitely like round one.
And then I just like, I just added these.
Yeah.
Okay, that makes more sense.
I like the first one better.
Yeah, I think I agree with that.
I don't think I would agree with that.
I'm not going to argue my results here.
You're going to use my data.
I just, I'm arbitrarily hitting buttons.
Okay, so we're submitting this.
And then we, I didn't write any notes.
Yeah, it's fine.
But that's fine.
And we submit that.
And then we're done.
Yeah.
And then we pause or we save this recording.
Yeah.
