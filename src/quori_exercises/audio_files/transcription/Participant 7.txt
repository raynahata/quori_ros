Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study.
My name is Cori. How are you today?
Good.
Great. Thanks for sharing. I am glad to hear that.
Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form next to you.
Please take a minute to read through the form. Please write your name when you are done and let me know.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm done.
Please read the block below your signature and choose one of the three options.
Done with that, too.
Thank you for signing the consent form.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Okay.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Yes.
Why do you exercise?
To build muscle.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
A 6.
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises.
Each set will be for 40 seconds.
Please do the exercises at your own pace.
In between each set, there will be a rest period.
Please look at the screen next to you to see how to perform the exercises.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
Can I stay sitting?
No, you should be standing.
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like, amazing
effort.
Let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like, focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing.
Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
The first way.
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise
session.
Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells if you want to use them.
So, okay.
Thank you.
