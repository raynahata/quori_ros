So you can take a seat or either stand in the box, it's up to you.
Oh, in the box?

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study.
My name is Corey. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? I am good. Thank you for asking.
Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form next
to you. Please take a minute to read through the form. Please write your name when you are
done and let me know.
Sounds good.
I granted the permission on the form.
It is asking me to get your instructions for the next steps.
Please read the block below your signature and choose one of the three options.
There should be a block below where you signed your name.
Oh, yeah, I already gave you permission.
It has three options.
Yeah, I gave you the permission.
You can go ahead.
Thank you for signing the consent form.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Go ahead.
How old are you?
I'm 27.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Yeah, from time to time.
Why do you exercise?
Where or how?
Why?
Oh, because I want to get fit.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
8
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
Sounds good.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises in between each set.
There will be a rest period.
Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm seeing the screen.
We have some dumbbells here for you to use if you choose to.
Yeah, I got that.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
My assistant can help you with any questions you have.
I think I'm good. Just let me know when I should start the exercise.
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like,
Amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like, Focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
The second way.
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise
session.
Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells if you want to use them.

Thank you.
I feel this way.
Cool.
Thank you.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
What do you think?
It's pretty good.
Like, so, I actually, like, did not know that there was going to be a round two.
so my round one feedback might have been like a little skewed so you're seeing the numbers like
my numbers are slightly more optimistic in the round one in the round one but when i experienced
round two i was like okay this is better uh although i wrote it so did you like round one
better around two although although the the categorization of round two is better but it
was not actually responding to it was not giving suggestions that were correct because i was
not feeling any fatigue, but it kept telling me
that keep going in spite of fatigue.
Those things, they make you confused.
It's like, from what basis is it understanding that I'm fatigued?
Am I doing something different?
So I will check my movements.
But I'm like, no, I'm doing the same exact movement.
I have a thought on that.
.
No, no.
So behind the scenes a little bit of why it
thinks you're fatigued.
So it has a heart rate.
Yeah.
And so there, it's basically there are, you know, certain zones that we can kind of defend of like, okay, if you're at 20% or this percent or that percent.
But what we, what those thresholds are for deciding when this is more, this is fatigue, this is not fatigue.
Oh, the delineation.
Yeah, so that's like, we don't know what those are.
So that's like me arbitrarily putting stuff and then seeing if it makes sense.
And if it doesn't make sense, we can change that.
So what I can do now is I can go and look at the heart rate data
and see what your numbers actually were
and then change the threshold based on that.
So that's kind of the whole point.
Yeah, yeah.
When is this fatigue?
It's, yeah.
Because I think it's...
Heart rate's 94.
No, what is your heart rate you're servicing?
Because that's the actual heart rate.
Heart rate.
What?
HRR.
.
Oh, yes.
Somebody walked off on the answer page.
Oh, yeah.
0.16.
Okay.
Yeah.
So the T is moderate.
Okay.
Yeah.
So then basically I have to – that's like on a percentage basis.
So what then I can do is change what I decide is – also, one more thing is like because
we are doing like strength exercises
