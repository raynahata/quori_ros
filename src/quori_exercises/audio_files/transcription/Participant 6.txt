I want to be the best coach I can be for you
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like,
Amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time.

Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
I like the first way.
