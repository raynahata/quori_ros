Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.
How old are you?
Old.
42.
Do you enjoy exercising?
Depends on the day.
Why do you exercise?
For my age, it's mostly for relieving stress and then keeping my old lady joints strong.

8.
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises.
Each set will be for 40 seconds.
Please do the exercises at your own pace.
In between each set, there will be a rest period.
Please look at the screen next to you to see how to perform the exercises.
Okay.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
Is it possible to sort of tell me when to start each thing?
So no, I guess.
I will tell you when to start and stop.
Okay.
Are we stretching?
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like,
amazing effort, let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like, focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
I think I like the second way.
but you're going to correct like during the exercise?
Yes, I will give you feedback during the exercise.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise
session.
