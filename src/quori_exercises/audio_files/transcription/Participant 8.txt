I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coach.
For example, when you make a mistake,
I could give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort.
Let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing.
Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
I think I like the second way.
