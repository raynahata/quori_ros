Welcome and thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study. My name is Cori. How are you today?
Not great.
I am sorry to hear that.
Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form in front of you.
Please take a minute to read through the form. Please write your name when you are done.
Okay.
Please read the block below your signature and choose one of the three options.
Should I be signing here?
I'm just anticipating

your human assistant

I put my name under
voluntary consent
by signing below

I was thrown off by the word
voluntary
well if you're
then you just leave
yeah that's fine
I was like okay yeah anyway
is there an involuntary consent
optional permission I grant
illustrative purposes
yeah I don't want my face
okay cool
Thank you for signing the consent form. Sure thing. As a recap you will be
completing a series of exercises and I will be evaluating you on your
performance. I will be recording your video and audio during the session. I
will also be asking you questions about your experience. I will be using this
information to improve my coaching skills. If you have any questions, my
assistant can answer them for you. Okay, sounds good.
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions. How old
are you? Should I answer truthfully? Yeah. Okay, 31.
Do you enjoy exercising? Not really. I do it because I have to. Why do you exercise?
Running, strength training, etc.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your energy level today?
What's 1 and what's 10?
1 is low energy, 7 is high energy.
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.
Okay.
You will perform two rounds with four sets each.
The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral raises in between each set.
There will be a rest period.
Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.
Got it.
All done.
We have some dumbbells here for you to use if you choose to.
Okay.
Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?
My assistant can help you with any questions you have.
Should I be sitting or standing?
Inside the box?
I want to be the best coach I can be for you.
So I want to understand how you like to be coached.
For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like,
amazing effort, let's aim for full range next time.
Or I could say something like, focus on improving your range.
Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?
Definitely the first.
Thank you for answering the question.
Before we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session.
Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells if you want to use them.
I have to do something.
We can worry about it.
Basically, I would just go in the room.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean, did the robot explain anything about the exercises?
You have to... I can't tell you.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
What next, Corey?
Okay, so you have your dumbbells and you just have to stand square.
And then the exercises are both arms at the same time.
It's trying its best.
Oh it is? Uh oh.
It was doing so well earlier.
It's like a once a day.
Oh, it's an afternoon slump.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna kill it.
I might need some coffee, I don't know.
Because I am a lady killer.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Get ready to start set one of four.
You will be doing bicep curls.
bicep curls now.
One suggestion, I think it would be good at this point for me to have the image.
Oh, okay. Well done.
Your form is looking really good today.
You're crushing those bicep curls.
Keep up the good work.
You're doing great.
Keep up the good work.
Almost done.
Rest.
How many reps was that?
How many reps was that?
I think we have too much information.
No, but it's true. If you set a...the problem is you set a precedent of the robot understanding and the way it doesn't understand.
There's like a process to it.
Rest for 20 more seconds.
Right now.
It might be interesting to just have a script where we just write during everything.
When everything else is winning, we just then step to the sound.
Oh.
Get ready to start set two at four.
You will be doing bicep curls.
Start bicep curls now.
Excellent job. Keep up the strong pace.
Do you have any suggestions for improvements?
I have a personal trainer on Tuesdays, you know, so this is just, I'm replacing my human trainer with this.
I'm not sure about this.
These are the questions I ask him.
Fantastic job. You've got great strength and form today.
Almost done. Rest.
Yeah, I think it might be worthwhile to have like a sort of Wizard of Oz thing in the background.
We've like thought about it, we just haven't...
Like, if it was like a second thing, I think like, if she was doing her thing, I could like...
Rest for 20 more seconds.
...set stuff randomly.
That like you can't...
That it's not like...
You know, like that computer is like this set stuff, and then this is like work handling things that take up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But...
We can think about that.
It should work, we just need a third computer.
Like we need another computer.
Get ready to start set three of four.
You will be doing lateral raises.
Start lateral raises now.
I have ideas how to do that.
Well done! Your form is looking great on these raises.
Are you also trying to do the raises for me?
You're doing fantastic! Keep up the good work!
Almost done.
rest I don't have a sense of what is going on
so like reps or pace like time do you want to know or yeah which is a little
disconcerting for me I don't know
like I think for rest it was rest for 20 more seconds this is a good thing right
So something like this during exercise.
So like 10 more seconds or something like that?
No, like just remember.
Yeah, like what is it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like when it says 20 seconds, it's obvious to me it's going to check the time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So it is time-based.
Get ready to start set 4 at 4.
You will be doing lateral raises.
Start lateral raises now.
I started this.
That's fair.
I think people aren't going to have questions because it is kind of giving the sense of a very capable robot.
You're doing great. Keep it up.
The other aspect, Marina, is that we have to be really poker-faced.
Now we can do it over and over again, but like on the actual thing.
Fantastic work on those lateral raises. You're almost there.
Almost done.
Rest.
Round complete. Please fill out a survey about this round.
I mean, it might be a personal thing actually. Maybe I need to know at the end.
maybe some people don't might be happy with the almost done
oh right now I mean for the next yeah well but when I'm doing the no no no do
Do I not have to be, oh, it's network connected.
No, it's Wi-Fi.
I just want to say, it's not plugged in.
It's just powered.
Oh.
So you can be back there.
I can be back there, okay.
So tomorrow we can do that.
Yeah.
If you want to be outside.
Yeah, I think that will help.
Also, you can sit right next to me and I can just talk.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought somehow this was connected to this computer for some odd reason or another.
So that desktop is up here.
Oh, this is just, okay.
Yeah, I'll just put that there.
There's a power.
You can unplug the microwave.
Okay.

Yes.
Okay.
