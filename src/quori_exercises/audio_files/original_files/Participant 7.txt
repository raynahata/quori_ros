[Speaker 3]
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.

You will perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls and the next two are lateral. Raises Each set will be for 40 seconds. Please do the exercises at your own pace in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen. Next to you to see how to perform the exercises.

Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine?

[Speaker 2]
Can I stay sitting?

[Speaker 3]
No, you should be standing.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I want to be the

[Speaker 3]
best coach I can be for you. So I want to understand how you like to be coached. For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time or I could say something like focus on improving your range. Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?

[Speaker 2]
The first way.
