[Speaker 1]
All right, I'm gonna log into my computer. Yeah.

Okay, I'm ready.

[Speaker 2]
Welcome in. Thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study. My name is Corey. How are you today?

[Speaker 3]
I'm doing

[Speaker 1]
Great. How are you?

[Speaker 3]
I

[Speaker 2]
Am good. Thank you for asking.

Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form in front of you. Please take a minute to read through the form. Please, write your name when you are done.

Please read the blog below your signature and choose one of the three options.

Thank you for signing the consent form.

Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.

Do you enjoy exercising?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I do.

Why do you exercise?

[Speaker 1]
Because it feels good.

[Speaker 2]
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your energy level today?

[Speaker 1]
Maybe like a seven.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.

You will perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls. And the next two are lateral raises in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Let's see. My computer. Just what? Okay. Okay, seeing biceps.

[Speaker 3]
I see.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, okay, I think I got it.

We have some

[Speaker 2]
Dumbbells here for you to use. If you choose to.

Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant can help you with any questions you have.

[Speaker 1]
No, I think I'm good.

I want to be

[Speaker 2]
The best coach I can be for you. So I want to understand how you like to be coached. For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time or I could say something like focus on improving your range. Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I think I like the first way.

[Speaker 2]
Before

[Speaker 1]
We start,

[Speaker 2]
Please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session. Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells, if you want to use them,

[Speaker 3]
Okay. Yeah, okay

[Speaker 1]
I'm gonna

[Speaker 4]
Add one more thing.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Um, Do you want me to? Okay, we're just gonna let this run. Yeah, it's fine just

[Speaker 4]
Before. Forget. Um,

[Speaker 1]
So I'm gonna hit next here.

I'm gonna fill out the intake. Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay. So

[Speaker 1]
What I need you. After you finish, you have to go in and look at resting heart rate. Yep. And then we can add that in.

[Speaker 3]
How do you look at some interesting heart rate

[Speaker 1]
On. So go to your intake logs and it should be in your intake blog. Unlike this last line.

[Speaker 4]
I know you put that in. You also very low lasting resting heart rate. Thank you. By the way, what is it? 62?

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

[Speaker 3]
So 62 and then I am 28. Yes. Um,

A very young Asian though.

[Speaker 4]
Huh. Very young for an aging adult.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I know you know.

[Speaker 4]
I didn't know you sneaky, but resting heart.

[Speaker 3]
We might, I don't

[Speaker 1]
Know if we want to ask, how old are you or like, because otherwise like you have to like look over the person's shoulder and see what number? I

[Speaker 4]
Can add it in here. I can be like uh resting like in one of the in

[Speaker 3]
The valuation. I can be like, how old are you? Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, yeah. Like when yeah, when you're asking all those questions Why is my computer? I'm so annoyed at it. Okay, it's fine.

[Speaker 4]
It's fine, it's fine. Um, yeah, because I realized the transition between asking the type and then just going straight to, like, go to dumbbells is bad. So I'm gonna be like after you ask attention, I think experience from the question. Now, before we start, this one was so good. Uh, validation, is there anything else you want me to ask them during evaluation age-wise or Democrats?

[Speaker 1]
I think that's it, because that's the only thing we like actually need.

Okay. So participants, do not go to the next state, so do we? We don't I don't have any notes here. Okay, so now we should be ready to go into round one.

[Speaker 3]
Um,

Yeah. All

[Speaker 1]
Three. Run through this. We can't talk. We can just double check that the. So the audio is clearly recording because I can see it. Yeah. We can double check that the video works. And then look at the data. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Then we're sorry. Did you pick the right thing for?

[Speaker 1]
So you have to, we have to look at this. Where's my So, the first round is encouraging, so you have to go into I can also do this particularly so.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, so that's correct. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then the next round would be

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 3]
Factory

[Speaker 1]
Working.

[Speaker 3]
See what?

[Speaker 1]
Look at see what my fingertips? Like the blocks?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah,

[Speaker 1]
It keeps on there. Do you see like it's been waterlogged?

[Speaker 2]
Almost done.

[Speaker 3]
Don't we all I need a restart.

Why is his arm just up?

[Speaker 1]
That was Reid's idea. He wanted like a another signal of like stuff,

[Speaker 3]
So

[Speaker 1]
It's like stop

[Speaker 2]
Got it rest for 20 more seconds.

[Speaker 1]
People have that question a lot, but I

[Speaker 4]
Think it's like it's like a It's yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
When you're doing

[Speaker 4]
Really encouraging, do you have the arms like party style?

[Speaker 1]
No, it does like move like more though. It's like

[Speaker 4]
Wow

[Speaker 1]
Because other reason like we picked those is because like people saw that as happy. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Ready to start set two at four, you will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 1]
So that you see like if you scroll down a little bit on there, no on the in the code.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 1]
How there's like a Cadence? Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So that I'm really crushing those biceps curls,

[Speaker 4]
You're crushing them,

[Speaker 2]
Keep up the good work.

[Speaker 1]
I'm like, I don't know if I want to like so we did that whole study that online study. And like people were

[Speaker 2]
Like, I definitely. Yeah, form is looking really good today. So but I'm

[Speaker 1]
Like, do I wanna? But people are like, two or three for like, basically all for both of them. So,

[Speaker 3]
I guess we can

[Speaker 1]
Like, see what people if people say like, oh, I'm

[Speaker 2]
Almost done.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Wrist.

[Speaker 1]
Because like the first set, it didn't say a lot but the second one is said like two or three things. So Are people doing

[Speaker 4]
Two sets of this entire code?

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay. So I

[Speaker 4]
Have to run it again. Yes. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then but

[Speaker 3]
Change the and

[Speaker 1]
You change the style. Yeah

[Speaker 4]
Style. Okay. Um, and

[Speaker 1]
We it has the time stamp in there so 20

[Speaker 2]
More seconds. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing we could put in there is like in the actually, I'll probably do. That is like You know, when you change the style also have like a thing that says like which round it is. Yeah

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Yeah. That

[Speaker 1]
Makes sense. Um what is does the file name have the style in it right now?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, start.

[Speaker 2]
Raises now.

[Speaker 1]
Because ordering changes is literally just for like, yeah, counterbalance. Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. That makes

[Speaker 3]
Sense.

[Speaker 4]
Try and think of, like, Do we want or maybe people do one one? And then one one. Because someone is four total.

Because like they're doing two rounds of two, right?

[Speaker 1]
That's rounds of four. Two hours

[Speaker 4]
Of weight.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. That costs two water raises, and then they switch. So they're eight total eight total. Do we want to shrink it? Yeah, keep

[Speaker 2]
Up the good work.

[Speaker 5]
Others are too short. I do it. That's true.

[Speaker 1]
Like it's not enough to like

[Speaker 2]
Almost done. Well

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, we'll see how long the study is the first pilot takes. If it's like way too long, then we can always shut it with

[Speaker 3]
The nose.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I mean I don't think maybe it's gonna tea for you. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Um, Yeah, the other thing we can do is Like,

[Speaker 3]
Have a chair

[Speaker 1]
Grab this. Be like a little a little stick for 20 more seconds. Yeah. The laptop here, put the phone here for recording purposes. And then just to make sure you're not gonna like whack it. I think you're not gonna whack it.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. Yeah. Then

[Speaker 1]
It'll all be. Like at least the Michael, because true, which will be nice. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

[Speaker 4]
Whisper AI. Does the whole transcribing and doing the person one person too but it requires a

[Speaker 3]
Key. So I was like, I don't. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
I did have the whole code set up and then I just went,

[Speaker 2]
Well, your farm is looking great on these raises.

[Speaker 3]
Perform is looking great. Thank you. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
Not me who actually trade this on my own data, but yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Can you imagine? You're you're a hundred percent mad. Wow, how did that?

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Fantastic. Keep up the good work.

[Speaker 1]
On the next run. I'll do something like God blessings.

Rest.

[Speaker 2]
Round complete. Please fill out a survey about this round.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Perfect. Um, can you comment out the plot.show in the study sessions file? Because we don't need to see that every time. Okay, so and then the next one is gonna be firm.

[Speaker 3]
Roblox style is one.

How do I put it still? Just,

[Speaker 1]
Uh, once you close all the plots that you quit by itself. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Any additional comments. Okay, next. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And then, I am ready for. For round two. Okay,

[Speaker 3]
Ready.

[Speaker 1]
Just for reference like this

[Speaker 2]
Recording. You will be doing bicep curls

[Speaker 1]
That's like not that long. Dark bicep

[Speaker 2]
Curls. Now

[Speaker 4]
Is your phone number's face.

[Speaker 1]
I think it I think it backs up to the drives. I could just delete locally. Okay. Yeah. Like at the end of each day. Yeah, that's why like we did before was like make just upload all the files to Google Drive. Like yeah. Labeled like because especially the, the video files are quite large. Yeah. So you have a long time to upload. Yeah. So I I think like what we did was like that was the last thing we did in the day and just like, let it run overnight because it takes forever. Yeah,

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. Um,

[Speaker 1]
And then you can just free up storage especially for only running like one or two or three people a day like yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That's like we're

[Speaker 6]
Not gonna run out of storage though. No almost done.

[Speaker 4]
Close this. If you do we can also rest bring like a local hard drive as well if

[Speaker 3]
You wanted to. Yeah, I mean,

[Speaker 1]
Even like a terabyte one. Yeah. So I'm

[Speaker 4]
Sure Aaron has a bunch, like, he has like, random crap lines. Oh yeah. I hope he doesn't see this

[Speaker 1]
Data recording. We're gonna have to It's fine.

[Speaker 3]
What is he gonna say?

The transcript's definitely not 20

[Speaker 1]
More seconds. So like there's like it said, it heard Aaron, but it it said Aaron has a bunch random crop lines. Good. Good. Good day. But it's better than like having them having nothing. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Get ready to start set two and four, you will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 3]
Everything's like don't go crazy and

[Speaker 5]
Go chop shaving off your entire head. I was like

[Speaker 1]
Who's that?

[Speaker 4]
My friend

[Speaker 3]
Oh I

[Speaker 4]
Just texted him. I was like yeah you know I just shaved the top half and died. The rest green. Nice.

[Speaker 3]
Focus on maintaining

[Speaker 2]
Proper elbow alignment throughout the exercise.

Almost done.

[Speaker 3]
Sometimes like I feel like the

[Speaker 1]
Arm or the it gets stuck

[Speaker 3]
So you have

[Speaker 1]
To like jiggle it a little bit and then it'll

[Speaker 4]
One day, it's just gonna pop right off us, I'll get,

[Speaker 3]
You know.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Good. Well, I'm yeah, I'm, I'm pleasantly surprised at how seamless that was. There's no

[Speaker 4]
Shy your heart rate 64 while you're doing this. Oh

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it probably is. 65.

[Speaker 3]
I stand up,

[Speaker 2]
Get ready to start set. Three of four. You will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah,

[Speaker 1]
So we have to make sure this figure is also plugged in all the time. Yep. And we could take the mouse with us. Yep.

[Speaker 4]
And we can bring a power strip and everything

[Speaker 2]
Maintain proper form to prevent shoulder injury.

[Speaker 1]
I'm sure I like that,

[Speaker 3]
But it's fine.

[Speaker 1]
It's not very encouraging, the way that that feedback was

Okay good.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, so

[Speaker 4]
You don't like firm feedback. Is what I'm hearing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Well, I'm going to spill it out of the survey. I'll tell them.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I don't like it.

[Speaker 2]
Almost done. Yeah. Rest,

[Speaker 1]
My motivation is lower. Exactly. Yeah. You don't you're like I don't I don't want to do this. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
That would be real time with me and my robot, but I'm gonna

[Speaker 1]
Try. Okay,

[Speaker 3]
What if I'm sitting down?

This sure

[Speaker 1]
Is not ideal because

[Speaker 2]
Rest for 20 more seconds.

[Speaker 3]
This one, I'll just all

[Speaker 1]
Just sit up here. I'm just not, I just wanted as a test to see if

[Speaker 4]
It'll still work.

[Speaker 3]
Because

[Speaker 1]
We could I was thinking we can have a chair for people to sit in while they're filling out the surveys.

[Speaker 2]
Raises. Start lateral raises.

[Speaker 7]
When you work with the first year,

[Speaker 1]
I guess so. What is it gen Z? Are you gen Z?

[Speaker 4]
I'm 2000. I don't know what

[Speaker 1]
I'm, I'm Millennial. So I'm the end of millennials.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I'm

[Speaker 4]
Gently. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
You can you can we can this shirt works? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I don't know. I think the camera angle's not good. So it's

[Speaker 2]
Almost done. Rest because if you want a chair with both sides or if you lower the rest, please fill out a survey about this round. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Wait, it should say, round two.

[Speaker 1]
Um, it's fine. Because it doesn't know what round it's doing right now.

[Speaker 3]
Watch our balloon.

[Speaker 1]
Okay so we're filling out round

[Speaker 3]
Two.

[Speaker 1]
The other thing that's interesting is like if you keep the mic here, people only talk to themselves while they're filling this out and you might get something interesting true. So

[Speaker 3]
They might be muttering, I

[Speaker 1]
Might be like, oh, yeah, this is.

[Speaker 4]
Did you save

[Speaker 1]
It? Yes.

[Speaker 4]
I didn't see what it happened.

[Speaker 1]
Oh wait, where did you comment? It was in study session.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, there was a controller.plot

[Speaker 1]
Angles.

[Speaker 5]
Got it. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Can

[Speaker 4]
I just comment that out? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, and then we have a final survey.

[Speaker 3]
Right there, I'm just

[Speaker 4]
Not final. This is the robot final survey.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's all the same, right? Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
But there's one more survey.

[Speaker 1]
I combined it though. Oh,

[Speaker 4]
You did. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So it's all in one page so it's easier. So, I definitely liked round one. And then I just like I just added these. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Okay,

[Speaker 4]
That makes more sense.

[Speaker 1]
I like the first one better. Uh yeah I think I agree with that. No, I don't think I would agree with that. You're trying to skew my results here.

[Speaker 6]
You're not gonna use my data. Like I just I'm arbitrarily hitting buttons. Okay, so we're submitting this

[Speaker 1]
And then we I didn't write anything yes, but that's fine.

[Speaker 3]
And we submit that. And then we're done. Yeah. And

[Speaker 4]
Then we pause or we save this recording. Yep.
