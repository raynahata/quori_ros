Welcome in. Thank you for taking the time to be part of this research study. My name is Corey. How are you today?

[Speaker 1]
Great. Thanks

[Speaker 3]
for sharing. I am glad to hear that.

Before we begin, I need to ask you some basic information and go over the consent form in front of you. Please take a minute to read through the form. Please, write your name when you are done.

[Speaker 1]
Do you have paper forms for old people?

Big font size. Yeah. I was just thinking or like, and maybe a regular Mouse or something. Oh, yeah. Just, she was

[Speaker 2]
gonna bring her iPod.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Oh, okay.

blog below your signature and choose one of the three options.

[Speaker 1]
Okay done. Thank you for signing

[Speaker 3]
the consent form.

Some sweet videos

[Speaker 1]
here.

You will

[Speaker 3]
perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls. And the next two are lateral raises in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.

[Speaker 1]
We have some dumbbells here for you

[Speaker 3]
to use. If you choose to.

Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant can help you with any questions you have.

[Speaker 1]
No, thanks.

Okay, I clearly definitely made a mistake. However, yeah, because

[Speaker 3]
I don't go along before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

How old are you? 42.

Do you enjoy

[Speaker 3]
exercising? Yes. Why do you exercise?

[Speaker 1]
To be fit enough to do the things I want to do.

[Speaker 3]
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your energy level today?

Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises.

[Speaker 1]
We're just gonna have to go for the exercise. Okay.

[Speaker 3]
You will perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls. And the next two are lateral raises in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.

We have some dumbbells here for you to use. If you choose to.

Do you have any questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant can help you with any questions you have.

[Speaker 1]
Nope.

What is part of Cory's projector face cut off? Uh, I want to

[Speaker 3]
be the best coach I can be for you. So I want to understand how you like to be coached. For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time or I could say something like focus on improving your range. Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way

[Speaker 1]
the second way?

[Speaker 3]
Thank you for answering the question.

[Speaker 1]
Before

[Speaker 3]
we start, please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session. Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells, if you want to use them,

[Speaker 1]
Okay, so that's on the

Good thing, it tells me not to do. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I don't think that it's healthy enough to do. Yep.

[Speaker 1]
I think the robot understood me. Well, Reyna.

How many children do I have? Is this just because like the AI caring form? Yes.

[Speaker 2]
He's gonna ask your grandchildren too. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, oh.

[Speaker 4]
Oh

[Speaker 1]
It's fine. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Where you just read them? Yeah.

I just don't want to over. This one's us too. Yeah, that's because I updated it. Yay.

Or I can remember. Yay. All right, do not go to the next page.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so yeah, you can just pick up the dumbbells and it just stands within the Box for the robot.

[Speaker 1]
Get ready to start

[Speaker 3]
set one of four. You will be doing bicep curls.

Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 1]
Great

[Speaker 3]
work. You're showing impressive progress.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, I know, but I wanted to know.

I know.

[Speaker 3]
Fantastic job on that last rep. Keep up the good work.

[Speaker 1]
You're

[Speaker 2]
not taking it personally or anything.

[Speaker 1]
The first one. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
For just a few more to go. Almost don't Rest.

[Speaker 1]
I toast everything. This is why I went first. I was like, I could sign up for Thursday, but no,

[Speaker 2]
yeah, Liz would break it. Surprisingly, the first slot on Monday,

[Speaker 4]
yeah, I was like

What's it doing?

[Speaker 3]
Rest for 20 more seconds.

[Speaker 1]
Or just like, it told you. My own fault for not listening. At least, you know, the timing is correct.

[Speaker 2]
Are you kidding? It's beautiful. Okay, it better be. There's a paper about it.

[Speaker 3]
Get ready to start set two at four. You will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

You're doing great. Keep up this strong work.

[Speaker 2]
Well, maybe it thinks you just can't move one of your arms, so it's not gonna yell at you.

[Speaker 1]
I switched arms.

[Speaker 3]
Fantastic, jump. Nice control with good speed.

[Speaker 1]
He's shaking,

[Speaker 3]
you're doing great. Keep pushing through almost done.

[Speaker 1]
On Travis.

Rest for

[Speaker 3]
20 more seconds.

Get ready to start set, three of four, you will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

[Speaker 2]
Can

[Speaker 1]
you catch me now?

[Speaker 2]
Rose.

[Speaker 1]
Oh,

It didn't

[Speaker 2]
freeze, it's because You're not doing what it expects you to do, it can't talk that there's reps happening sometimes so

[Speaker 1]
is it supposed to be

[Speaker 3]
almost done?

[Speaker 1]
Decides how long it is? Or is it an interval? Is it time? It did catch

[Speaker 2]
Sometimes it it catches when it's wrong but it won't tell you

[Speaker 1]
yeah, like it, it did catch. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
It just depends on the Because you support him.

[Speaker 3]
Rest for 20 more seconds.

[Speaker 2]
You have to make the same mistaple to the times of the world, sometimes for it. I'm giving you two.

[Speaker 1]
Fine, seeing her. Not that she knows. There's nothing about yourself,

[Speaker 2]
so obviously it hasn't seen the surveys already or anything now,

[Speaker 3]
Get ready to start set 404, you will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

You're doing great. Keep it up.

[Speaker 1]
I'm doing great.

Fantastic work

[Speaker 3]
on those lateral raises, you're almost there. Almost done rest. Round complete. Please fill out a survey about this round.

[Speaker 1]
So, you got it.

Everyone's like, write it all out. Especially with the all right. Yeah yeah. There's two parts.

Get ready to

[Speaker 3]
start set one of four. You will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 1]
Focus on maintaining

[Speaker 3]
proper form despite feeling fatigued.

[Speaker 1]
Focus on

[Speaker 3]
maintaining good form despite feeling fatigue.

[Speaker 1]
Almost done.

[Speaker 3]
Rest.

[Speaker 1]
My little ribs really add up after a while. Yeah.

Hmm everyone comes in here and gets a workout.

[Speaker 2]
That was my ad.

[Speaker 1]
I had a bicep workout but at least a little bit of lateral reasons. Rest

[Speaker 3]
for 20 more seconds. Get them.

[Speaker 2]
Bigger weights before. Oh yeah. Like I think we've got it to like eight or ten. Maybe. And then like for vice versa you could still getta. Look at it. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And pad up.

[Speaker 2]
We tried, we tried.

[Speaker 3]
Get ready to start. We will be doing bicep curls.

[Speaker 2]
He needs to bring his own weights.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, that's awesome cruels now.

Focus on maintaining proper form despite fatigue.

[Speaker 1]
So it can't be specific. It can after putting over here,

[Speaker 3]
focus on maintaining proper form despite tiredness.

If it

[Speaker 2]
doesn't have a specific

[Speaker 3]
almost done

[Speaker 2]
that you're making, it'll just rest.

[Speaker 1]
Rest for

[Speaker 3]
20 more seconds.

[Speaker 1]
Aaron seemed slightly concerned about this thing going into color. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I am concerned. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Clearly it's really stable. I probably be a baby.

[Speaker 2]
I think Greg said he's gonna, he can rent the truck.

[Speaker 3]
Get ready to start set. Three of four. You will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

[Speaker 1]
Almost

[Speaker 3]
done.

[Speaker 2]
That's not a book

[Speaker 3]
rest,

[Speaker 2]
it just won't. It's a feature.

[Speaker 1]
So you don't accidentally shame old people.

[Speaker 2]
The thing is, if you keep if they're going really slow, you don't want to keep yelling at them. Yeah. For being too slow.

[Speaker 1]
Rest for 20 more seconds. So yeah,

[Speaker 2]
that one was actually

[Speaker 1]
Rain of the painting, wouldn't keep them.

Get ready to start

[Speaker 3]
set forward four, you will be doing lateral raises. Start lateral raises. Now

[Speaker 1]
You're also not want to show people who are paralyzed on one side, correct.

[Speaker 3]
Focus on keeping your shoulders level for better form.

[Speaker 1]
Focus on

[Speaker 3]
maintaining proper form, even when fatigue.

[Speaker 1]
Almost done.

[Speaker 3]
Rest.

Round complete. Please fill out a survey about this round.

[Speaker 1]
All right, and then yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I hope do not go there. Yeah.

[Speaker 5]
Click next month, in the next round.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can help. All right.

[Speaker 1]
Single learning things.

You can

[Speaker 2]
also just make it all in the same fish.

[Speaker 1]
It's true.

Can you

[Speaker 2]
change that file name with that one

[Speaker 1]
to two? This one is one. I will.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Before cuz I don't, I guess like, when we upload it, I just don't want it to. Yeah, yeah I'll change

[Speaker 1]
that

[Speaker 2]
or I guess we'll meet up. It'll be different kind of jokes, but yes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh yeah.

All right, are you done? Yeah. I don't know if people are gonna notice. Like rate differently for the awesome job stuff.

[Speaker 2]
The part, that's the part that's turkey is that was tricky. Even when I ran this, Like last year where it was just like, did you pilot? No question. Okay, so the study setup was basically they did one round. Uh, so you did two rounds here, so they did three rounds in that one. The first round was the robot. Didn't see anything. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And then they got

[Speaker 2]
a random order of firm or

[Speaker 1]
encouragement and

[Speaker 2]
the whole purpose of that was to basically be like to keep people saw the difference. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And

[Speaker 2]
can do people perform differently

[Speaker 1]
and we did find that

[Speaker 2]
people could like tell and yeah um that people perform differently. This one is, I think We have that validation of like, these things are different. Yeah, yeah. We hopefully can see like, okay, if we like, ask people stuff in the beginning,

[Speaker 1]
How does that

[Speaker 2]
kind of correlate? With what they say?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Well, I wonder too like If you have very motivated people then maybe they're more, they're gonna be like more circumspect about it. As opposed to random undergrads hitting five was all the way down. Yeah. Right.

[Speaker 2]
And I think the other part that's tricky is like, it's also dependent. Like what you hear from the robot is to find out how well you do, right? Yeah, like if you do, this is something that I struggled with last last year, too, because it's like, okay, if you get the encouraging robot but then you make a bunch of mistakes. Then you're gonna be. That robot is more critical. Yeah, for It's not because of what the robot's doing. It's based on like what you did. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. And so, like, each

[Speaker 2]
person isn't seeing the same. Like, is it hearing the same things from the robot? So that just makes it. You just we just kind of hope that like there isn't even doubt. Yeah, and then it kind of all Did

[Speaker 1]
you think of, uh, motivation circuit questions? I added the last three questions. Oh, seemed fine. Seems okay. Yeah, I took the three question. One, just because, and then the questions that you heard from the robot were Basically me translating them into question form. Oh okay. The one after age is the one that I did. Yeah, I think. If the screen would, it wasn't Frozen. Asked you. I can show you.
