[Speaker 2]
As a recap, you will be completing a series of exercises and I will be evaluating you on your Performance, I will be recording your video and audio during the session. I will also be asking you questions about your experience. I will be using this information to improve my coaching skills. If you have any questions, my assistant can answer them for you.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, sounds good.

[Speaker 2]
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.

[Speaker 1]

[Speaker 1]
Okay, 31. Do

[Speaker 2]

[Speaker 2]
Why do you exercise?

[Speaker 4]
Um, Running strength training. Etc.

Bread

[Speaker 1]
brief every day. Okay?

[Speaker 2]
On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your energy level today?

[Speaker 4]
Um, What's one and what's ten?

[Speaker 1]
What is low energy today? Thank you. Okay. Um, seven.

Thank you for answering the questions.

[Speaker 2]
I will now explain the exercises.

[Speaker 4]
Okay.

[Speaker 2]
You will perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls. And the next two are lateral raises in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen in front of you to see how to perform the exercises.

[Speaker 1]
Got it.

[Speaker 2]
All

[Speaker 1]
done. We have some

[Speaker 2]
dumbbells here for you to use. If you choose to

[Speaker 6]
Okay. Do you have

[Speaker 2]
any questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant can help you with any questions you have.

[Speaker 4]
Should I be sitting or standing? Inside the Box.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it'll tell you, okay.

I want to be the best

[Speaker 2]
coach I can be for you. So I want to understand how you like to be coached. For example, when you make a mistake, I can give you feedback. That sounds like amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time or I could say something like focus on improving your range. Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second wave?

[Speaker 4]
Definitely the first.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you for answering the question.

[Speaker 1]
Before we start,

[Speaker 2]
please fill out a survey about how I introduced you to the exercise session. Once you are done, please pick up the dumbbells, if you want to use them,

[Speaker 4]
I

[Speaker 1]
have

[Speaker 4]
to do something.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, boy, maybe it's fine. We can we can worry about it, but basically I would just just go with it, right? Okay. So let's do that. Yeah, yeah.

I mean, did

[Speaker 6]
the robot explain anything about the exercises?

[Speaker 1]
You have to I can't tell you that, okay. Um,

Okay.

What next Corey? Okay, so you hear the dumbbells and You just look sad and square feet. The exercises are both arms.

[Speaker 4]
Is trying its best. Oh, it is.

[Speaker 1]
Oh It was doing so well earlier. It's like a once a day. Oh it's just. It's a afternoon slump. Yeah. Okay, I'm like I'm gonna kill it. We're getting some coffee. I don't know. Does anyone let me tell it?

Which is comfortable? The Turtle Point terminal. I'm just gonna get us in the trash.

[Speaker 2]
Get ready to start set one of four. You will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 1]
Um, one suggestion, I think

[Speaker 7]
it would be good at this point for me to have the image.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2]
Well, done. Your arm is looking really good today.

[Speaker 1]
That was a bit creepy.

You're

[Speaker 2]
crushing those bicep curls, keep up the good work.

[Speaker 1]
You're doing

[Speaker 2]
great. Keep up the good work. Almost done rest.

[Speaker 4]
How many reps is that?

[Speaker 1]
No, it is true. If you said, uh, the the problem is you set a precedent of the robot understanding and the way it doesn't understand. There's like there's like six for 20 more seconds.

Right now, they're my feet. It might be interesting to just have like a script where we just Like during everything, but everything else is running including just sends stuck to

[Speaker 4]
Oh,

[Speaker 2]
get ready to start set two at four, you will be doing bicep curls. Start bicep curls now.

[Speaker 1]
Excellent job.

[Speaker 2]
Keep up the strong Pace. Do

[Speaker 4]
you have any suggestions for improvements?

[Speaker 1]
Dying.

[Speaker 8]
I have a personal trainer on Tuesdays, you know, so this is just I'm I'm replacing my human trainer with this.

[Speaker 4]
Another question if I ask him.

[Speaker 2]
Fantastic job. You've got great strength and form today.

[Speaker 1]
Almost

[Speaker 2]
done. Rest.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, I think it might be worthwhile to have like a Sort of Wizard of Oz. Thing in the background

[Speaker 1]
job, we really thought about it. We just Like I think like I like if she was doing quickly, yeah I could like

[Speaker 2]
rest for 20 more seconds. I'm suffering. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
You. And it's not like, you know, they like that computer is like a this set stuff and then this is like a work handling things as we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But It's just it should work. We just need a third computer like we did it. Just another email.

[Speaker 2]
Get ready to start set. Three of four, you will be doing lateral raises. Statilateral raises now.

[Speaker 1]
You just need to do anything wrong. You slow though.

[Speaker 2]
Well no, your form is looking great on these raises.

[Speaker 4]
Are you also trying to get

[Speaker 1]
the Ravens score?

So you recapturing. Good audio.

[Speaker 2]
You're doing fantastic. Keep up the good work.

Almost done. Rest.

[Speaker 4]
I don't have a sense of What is going on? So like wraps or paints like time. Yeah, which is a little disconcerting for me.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. I don't know

[Speaker 4]
if other people would want more information.

[Speaker 7]
Like, I think, for rest it was released for 20 more seconds. This is a

[Speaker 4]
good thing, right? So something like this, during exercise,

[Speaker 9]
like 10 more seconds or

[Speaker 4]
something like that. Oh no. Like just look at

[Speaker 1]
the very bird. Yeah. Like

[Speaker 7]
what what? What is it?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, right.

[Speaker 7]
Like when it says 20 seconds. It's obvious to me. It's gonna change.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah yeah yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You will be doing collateral raises start lateral raises. Now,

[Speaker 4]
That's fair. I,

[Speaker 1]
I

[Speaker 4]
think, I think people are gonna have Questions, because it is kind of giving the sense of a very capable robot. Um, so You're

[Speaker 2]
doing great. Keep it up.

[Speaker 1]
Is that we have to be really easy. Like geographies. Yeah, now we can do it every room.

[Speaker 4]
Oh yeah. But like

[Speaker 1]
oh, the actual thing. Oh, I'll be in the

[Speaker 2]
Fantastic work on those lateral raises, you're almost there.

Because

[Speaker 1]
you don't want to explode. Oh no,

[Speaker 2]
almost done.

Round complete. Please fill out a survey about this round.

[Speaker 7]
I mean it might be a personal thing actually. Maybe I need to know the end. Maybe some

[Speaker 1]
people don't yeah might be

[Speaker 7]
happy with the almost done.

[Speaker 4]
You could also sit here. Oh, right now. I mean for the next. Yeah. Well

[Speaker 9]
but When I'm doing the dude, because you need a desk. No, no, no. Do I not have to be it? Always network connected, but it was Wi-Fi. I'm saying it's like it's not plugged in, it's just powered

[Speaker 1]
oh, Okay. So next and next tomorrow we can do that. Yeah. If you want to be outside.

[Speaker 9]
thought that somehow this was like connected to this computer.
