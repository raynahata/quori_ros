Thank you, Corey.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you.

They got compensated for this. No. Oh no.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. Do you have any feedback questions?

[Speaker 1]
I just find it it's

[Speaker 4]
kind of awkward first though the face looks a little awkward

[Speaker 2]
um

[Speaker 4]
and then I was probably Auto Care control and also the voice in

[Speaker 1]
general and also

[Speaker 4]
I got really confused when you lift his arm.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, I don't know what that means.

[Speaker 4]
So like, take a c or something? Yeah, so that's

[Speaker 2]
um, Basically like a like a almost like a stop like a window.

[Speaker 4]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
there's a good sub. It doesn't have an elbow, you can't kind of, yeah,

[Speaker 4]
yeah, the right trajectory for it. So,

[Speaker 2]
but it's like basically a a visual indicator of like, when that's arm it's out, you're like resting. And then when it's not,

[Speaker 1]
then

[Speaker 4]
it's closely exercising,

[Speaker 1]
I say, well,

[Speaker 2]
yeah, I we have gotten that feedback that it is confusing.

[Speaker 4]
Uh, the other thing I put down is like, I feel like almost done. It's too close to die. Like,

[Speaker 2]
oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
yeah. Like, it's always like immediately after almost done. It's like, oh, it rest. So

[Speaker 2]
yeah. Yeah, that's something we can fix.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
that's that's just yeah. I think that's it.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, cool? Yeah.

[Speaker 4]
Okay,

[Speaker 2]
thank you. Welcome. Um, I don't know. Fine is being appropriate.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, but we will have some kind of time.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. If

[Speaker 2]
you're our last one for the day oh really nice.

[Speaker 4]
Nice.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we'll see if he might need to run a couple more next week after we discuss and see we want to make changes to some things. But

[Speaker 4]
gotcha, gotcha. It says, for your thesis word,

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, it's like it's kind of I mean this is like a step in the direction of like this

[Speaker 1]
work. The, the part that

[Speaker 2]
I proposed was basically the Adaptive personalized like where it changes its style. While you're doing

[Speaker 1]
so,

[Speaker 2]
that's the point of action. This is like Basically a step along the way of like, if you ask people what their preferences are, how does that correlate to like, how your department, how they respond? Because that can kind of, give the model, like a question the right direction,

[Speaker 4]
okay? For like, when

[Speaker 2]
you're learning because you, I'm

[Speaker 1]
gonna

[Speaker 2]
suffer further from the problem, like, not enough to get because

[Speaker 1]
you

[Speaker 2]
can't have people exercise forever. Yeah. So like

[Speaker 4]
the,

[Speaker 2]
you know, ideally you'd be like trained for like a long time and you'd be able to, The person would do like or like respond in a very adaptively but like I'm not realistic. Yeah. So like

[Speaker 4]
seeing

[Speaker 2]
like in

[Speaker 1]
kind of

[Speaker 2]
get a little bit of a head start there to

[Speaker 4]
get it fired. Uh,

[Speaker 2]
yeah, because we get a fire so that, like, okay, at least you're starting out with something. They said they liked,

[Speaker 1]
uh,

[Speaker 2]
And then obviously, you can change as you go along and then first up is like related to the understanding like How motivation like people how people said they were motivated. How does that kind of tie into everything?

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, so, we're we, we're combining for whatever has seen it. Yeah. Oh, cool. That's cool. It. All right, I'll leave you guys the way. Yeah.

Oh, you have meaning, 10 minutes?
