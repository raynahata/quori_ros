Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Very cool. Okay, sounds good?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
What'd you think?

[Speaker 2]
It's pretty good. Like so, um, I actually like Did not know that there's going to be around two. So my round one feedback might have been like a little skewed.

[Speaker 3]
So you would

[Speaker 2]
see in the numbers, like my numbers are slightly more Optimistic in the round one, in the round one. But when I experience round two, I was like, okay, this is better. Although, Although although the the categorization of round two is better but it was not actually responding to It was not giving suggestions that were corrective, because I was not feeling any fatigue, but it kept telling me that keep going in spite of a tick, you know, those those things they make you confused. It's like

[Speaker 3]
From

[Speaker 2]
what basis is it understudy? That I am particular. Am I doing something different? So I will check my movements but I'm like no I'm doing the same exact movement.

No, no. It's

[Speaker 6]
so Behind the scenes a little bit of why it thinks you're fatigued so you have your heart rate.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Right. And so

[Speaker 6]
there it it's basically there are you know certain zones that we can

[Speaker 3]
kind of

[Speaker 6]
set of like oh okay. If you're At 20 or as percent, or that percent. But what we, what those thresholds are for deciding when this is more, this is fatigue, this is

[Speaker 2]
oh, they're deviation.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. So that's like, we don't know what things are. So right, that's like a me arbitrarily putting stuff and, and seeing if it makes sense, it makes sense. We can change that.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah,

[Speaker 6]
so like what I can do now is like, I could go and look at the heart rate data and see what what your numbers actually were. And then change the thresholds based on that. So that's kind of the whole point. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. One is his fatigue. It's yeah. Cuz like I think it's um, 94.

[Speaker 6]
No. What is your heart rate reserves?

[Speaker 3]
Because that's actually important, but not right.

[Speaker 6]
What HRR, because RR

Oh yeah. 0.16 Okay

[Speaker 1]
yeah

[Speaker 2]
this side

[Speaker 1]
so the deepest moderate.

[Speaker 6]
Okay yeah

[Speaker 3]
so

[Speaker 6]
then basically I have to that's like I don't know, 100 percentage

[Speaker 3]
basis and

[Speaker 6]
so what then I can do is change what I decide is. Um, also, one, one more thing is like because we are doing, like, strength exercises
