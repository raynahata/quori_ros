As a recap, you will be completing a series of exercises and I will be evaluating you on your Performance, I will be recording your video and audio during the session.

[Speaker 2]
Before I explain the exercises, I would like to ask you a few questions.

On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your energy level today?

Thank you for answering the questions. I will now explain the exercises. You will perform two rounds with four sets each. The first two sets will be bicep curls. And the next two are lateral raises in between each set. There will be a rest period. Please look at the screen, next to you to see how to perform the exercises.

[Speaker 2]
questions about the exercises or the routine? My assistant can help you with any questions you have.

[Speaker 1]
I have no questions.

[Speaker 2]
I want to be the best coach I can be for you. So I want to understand how you like to be coached. For example, when you make a mistake, I could give you feedback that sounds like amazing effort. Let's aim for full range next time or I could say something like focus on improving your range. Keep pushing. Do you think you like the first way or the second way? The first way,

[Speaker 1]
